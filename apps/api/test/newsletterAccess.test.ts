// The newsletter router's TWO gates, at the route (invariant 31).
//
// test/ptoAccess.test.ts proves the roster gate FUNCTION decides correctly —
// `newsletterAccess` is that same function keyed on a different setting, so
// nothing about `self_asserted` or the bootstrap case is re-proved here. This
// proves which routes ask which gate, which is the part a refactor can get
// wrong silently: an issue route that quietly kept `isSystemAdmin` locks the
// editors out of one screen, and a subscriber route that quietly took
// `requireEditor` hands every family's email address to the whole committee.
//
// Three properties:
//
//   1. Every issue route admits an editor — someone on the roster who is NOT a
//      system admin — and refuses a member who isn't.
//   2. Every system-admin route refuses that same editor.
//   3. GET /newsletter/access answers a non-editor, so the app can route them.
//
// The list is enumerated by hand. Add a route to routes/newsletter.ts, add it
// here — a route missing from this list is what nothing else will notice.
