// Deleting an authored event takes its volunteer sheets with it.
//
// This is a coupling nothing in either file states. `volunteer_sheet` keys on
// `(managed_event_id, occurrence_start)` — the durable pair, never
// `calendar_event.id` (CLAUDE.md invariants 8 and 13) — so its foreign key is
// `managed_event(id)`, the exact row a delete removes. Take the event without
// the sheets and, depending on whether foreign keys are enforced, you either get
// a constraint failure or something worse and quieter: sheets, positions and
// SIGNUPS that survive in the tables while `sheetRow`'s join to `managed_event`
// makes every one of them invisible to every read. Nobody notices, because the
// symptom of the bad case is nothing at all.
//
// The order is asserted as well as the presence: children first, then the event.
//
// The counts are asserted too, and for a reason with no second chance. They are
// read BEFORE the delete and kept on the audit row, because afterwards there is
// no way to learn how many people had claimed a spot on an event that no longer
// exists — an audit entry naming only the id of a deleted row says almost
// nothing (invariant 5).
