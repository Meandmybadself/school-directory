// Public newsletter surface — no authentication, by design.
//
// Same trust posture as routes/ics.ts, and the same warning applies with more
// force: NOTHING member-specific may ever be added to these responses. The
// archive is deliberately addressed by a human-readable dated slug, so issues
// are enumerable and crawlable. That is the point — a newsletter link has to
// open from an inbox, a text message or a Facebook group with no sign-in — but
// it means an issue's body must never contain member-private content.
//
// Only issues that have actually been sent are visible; a draft's slug resolves
// to a 404, so guessing tomorrow's URL reveals nothing.
//
// Sign-up lives here too, and is DOUBLE opt-in: POST /subscribe only mails a
// confirmation link, and POST /subscribe/confirm/:token is the sole thing that
// writes to newsletter_subscriber. The form is anonymous and public, so the
// address it carries is an unproven claim until the link mailed to that address
// comes back. See migration 0013 for why the token is not an auth_token.
