 *
 * Three things it does, and the reason each is spelled the way it is:
 *
 *   Control of the inviter's household Persons is granted by an
 *   `INSERT … SELECT`, evaluated against what the INVITER controls right now
 *   rather than a list frozen at send time. A child added between sending the
 *   invitation and clicking it is a child the co-parent should get, and one the
 *   inviter has since lost control of is not.
 *
 *   The Persons come from `membership` joined to `control`, never from `person`.
 *   That is not incidental: the enumeration gate (invariant 21) would be the
 *   wrong predicate to apply here — the invitee is becoming a Controller, which
 *   is one of the two audiences the gate admits — and reading the table at all
 *   would spend one of the scan's few remaining exemptions to no purpose.
 *
 *   Household admin is granted only where a membership already exists, so this
 *   can never make someone an admin of a household they are not in. It carries
 *   the `household_admin` capability with it for the same reason POST /groups
 *   does: the badge and the authority are one fact.
