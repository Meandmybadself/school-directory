// Operating the bingo board — the write half of apps/bingo.

// Any session will do, like submitting a lost & found item (invariant 33):
// running the board is a game-night chore, not a read of member data, so
// neither `requireApproved` nor a roster gate is asked. What the session
// buys is a closed door against the open internet — the board's state is
// public to READ (routes/bingoPublic.ts), and an anonymous PUT would let
// anyone who finds the hostname wipe a live game.
