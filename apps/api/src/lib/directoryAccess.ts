// Reading the directory is granted, not conferred by signing up (migration
// 0029, invariant 32). This file is the whole of that decision: what a complete
// application looks like, what state an account is in, and the guard the gated
// routes call.
//
// WHY AN APPLICATION AND NOT AN ALLOWLIST. An allowlist judges an email
// address, which asserts nothing and can be checked against nothing short of
// the district's own family roster — and asking for that roster would put
// education records in this system, which today holds none. An application
// judges what the applicant TYPED: their name, their child's name, and the room
// that child is in, chosen from the classroom groups this instance already
// carries under the district's own names. A reviewer checks that in seconds.
//
// WHAT APPROVAL IS NOT. It is not proof of anything. A determined person can
// type a plausible room. What it removes is the ANONYMOUS population: every
// reader of the directory has told us a child's name and a teacher, and that is
// attribution. Rate limiting is the other half and is a separate mechanism.

 * can tell whether the child is real, and pretending otherwise would be the
 * allowlist's mistake in a new place. What they guarantee is that a reviewer is
 * given something to look at.
 *
 * `studentPlaced` accepts a `self_asserted = 1` membership, which is the only
 * kind a parent can create for their own child (invariant 27) — the whole point
 * is that they tell us the room and somebody then decides whether to believe
 * it. Approval is what promotes that row to trusted.
 *
 * TWO ROUTES, because the school is not only parents. The first version asked
 * every applicant for a child, which a teacher, the office or the nurse cannot
 * produce — so they met a form with two conditions they could never satisfy and
 * a button that never enabled. They were not locked out (an admin can approve
 * from the "Never asked" tab) but they had no way to ASK, and nothing told
 * anyone they were waiting. A gate with no door for a whole category of the
 * people it serves is a bug, not a policy.
 *
 * So a Person the applicant controls holding `teacher` or `staff` is the other
 * way to a complete claim. Anyone can assert that — both are in
 * `ASSIGNABLE_CAPABILITIES` and `POST /me/persons` asks nobody, the same thing
 * invariant 27 says about `student` — and that is fine for the same reason it
 * is fine there: this decides what a reviewer is SHOWN, not what anyone may
 * read. "I teach in Rm 110" is exactly as checkable by a human who has the
 * staff list as "my child is in Rm 110", and both still wait for that human.
 *
 * Staff are deliberately NOT asked for a classroom. A teacher has a room; the
 * office, the nurse and the custodian do not, and requiring one would rebuild
 * the dead end a segment further along. The free-text note is where a staff
 * applicant says which room or which job, and the admin queue shows it.
 *
 * Reads `person` only through `control`, so which Persons exist to this caller
 * was already settled by the join: the applicant's own. It spends none of
 * test/personListable.test.ts's exemption budget.
