// Sending an issue: the state machine and the fan-out.
//
// Two properties this has to have, and how each is obtained:
//
//   Idempotency. A double-clicked Send must not mail everyone twice. The
//   transition into 'sending' is a compare-and-swap —
//   `UPDATE ... SET status='sending' WHERE id=? AND status='draft'` — and the
//   loser of the race sees `changes === 0` and is turned away. D1 is a single
//   writer per database, so this needs no external lock. Crucially the CAS runs
//   BEFORE the slow work (audience + event resolution), which is the only
//   ordering that actually closes the race.
//
//   Resumability. Every recipient gets a 'pending' newsletter_send row before
//   any mail is attempted. A fan-out cut short — a recycled Worker, a Resend
//   outage — therefore leaves a state that can be read and resumed rather than
//   one nobody can interpret. Since the October 2026 send (69 of 94 recipients
//   failed in one unpaced, unbounded blast), resuming is also the NORMAL path,
//   not only recovery: each run is budgeted under the Workers free plan's
//   per-invocation subrequest cap and paced under Resend's per-second meter,
//   and `resumePendingSends` (riding the store's 15-minute cron) carries a
//   yielded or killed run forward. A run processes 'pending' rows only;
//   'failed' means Resend gave a verdict re-sending can't change, and only the
//   manual retry route (which resets failed -> pending) re-enters those.
