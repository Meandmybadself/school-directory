// eisenhower.school/privacy — the formal notice.
//
// It exists because a parent asked the right question and deserved an answer
// they could read without an account, and because "we take privacy seriously"
// is not an answer. Every claim on this page is one the code can be checked
// against, which is the only kind worth publishing: private-by-default is
// `contact_item.visibility`, the absent public level is the absent fourth
// chip, the approval step is invariant 32, and the list of services is the set
// of hostnames this project actually fetches.
//
// Three properties it shares with `/faq`, for the same reasons:
//
//  - It makes NO subrequest, so it is a pure function of the URL,
//    `Accept-Language` and the `sd_lang` cookie. A privacy notice that could be
//    emptied by the API having a bad afternoon would be worse than none.
//  - Every word comes from the shared dictionaries (invariant 6), so it exists
//    in all four languages the day `LOCALES` does — and this is the page where
//    that matters most, since the families least likely to read English are the
//    ones with least other recourse if the answer is wrong.
//  - It is an INDEXED surface (the fifth), so nothing member-private may appear
//    on it and `INDEXED_PATHS` in index.ts is what puts it in the sitemap.
//
// One thing it does NOT do: ask to be agreed to. There is no banner, no
// checkbox and no "by continuing you accept". Consent theatre on a school
// directory would be a lie about who holds the power here — a parent's real
// control is the per-field visibility setting and the delete button, both of
// which this page points at.
//
// `privacyBusBody` is a promise made in public, in four languages, to families
// who asked — transportation data is the thing the concern that prompted this
// page named outright. What depends on it is the trust of every family who
// reads it: if a future version of this project ever wants that data, this page
// changes first and the change is visible to everyone, which is the whole point
// of writing a commitment down rather than merely intending it.
