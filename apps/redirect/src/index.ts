// Hostname redirector. This Worker owns hostnames that exist only to send a
// visitor somewhere else, and 301s every request on each of them.
//
// Two kinds of entry live in the map:
//
// - A legacy host, which forwards to a live host PRESERVING the path and
//   query. directory.meandmybadself.com is that case: magic-link emails sent
//   before the move point at /auth/callback?token=… on the old host, and those
//   links must keep working.
//
// - A vanity host, which forwards to one fixed URL and DISCARDS the path — a
//   short name people can say out loud for a link nobody can. ptomeet is that
//   case: the PTO's standing Google Meet room. Nothing on such a host has a
//   path worth keeping, so ptomeet.eisenhower.school/anything lands on the room.
//
// Add a hostname here AND as a custom_domain route in wrangler.toml; wrangler
// provisions the DNS record and certificate on deploy. Don't reach for a
// Cloudflare redirect rule instead — those run before Workers and are not
// tracked in this repo (see CLAUDE.md, "The front door").
