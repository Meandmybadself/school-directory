// One event's own page — the dedicated URL at /e/:date/:slug.
//
// Ungated, like the agenda at `/` and the volunteer sheet at /v/:slug: an event
// link's whole job is to open from a text message. It reads
// /calendar-public/events/:date/:slug when signed out, and re-reads the
// members-only twin ONLY for a system admin, which is the one thing that adds —
// `seriesId`, the durable handle the edit form opens. Same two-step the agenda
// does, and for the same reason: a shared link must not wait on /me.
//
// The path is a CONTENT identity, not an id — see packages/shared/src/eventPath.ts
// for why an event can't be addressed any other way, and what that costs. The
// consequence to know here is that this page exists for an imported ICS event
// just as much as for one authored in this app; only the admin and volunteer
// affordances are managed-only, and both are absent by construction (an imported
// event has no `seriesId` and can carry no sheet).
//
// It is also the ONLY page a volunteer sheet is read on. /v/:slug used to render
// its own near-copy of this one; it now resolves the slug and forwards here with
// `?sheet=`, which this page honours so that a sheet the event alone would not
// surface still opens — see screens/VolunteerRedirect.tsx and `sheetSlug` below.
