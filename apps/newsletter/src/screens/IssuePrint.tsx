// GET /admin/issues/:id/print — an issue laid out for paper, for the admin who
// is already signed in.
//
// Why this is an SPA route and not a Pages Function like its two public
// siblings: the session cookie is host-only to the API's hostname and is never
// present on a navigation to this origin, so a Function here structurally
// cannot tell an admin from anyone else (see functions/_lib/page.ts). Routing
// the admin's own "view as PDF" through a minted review link instead would
// conflate two independent features and make a one-click action require
// creating a shareable secret first.
//
// It renders through the SAME renderer the public page and the email use
// (invariant 9) — this is its fifth call site, and the fourth that runs it in a
// browser rather than at the edge, exactly as PreviewPane already does for the
// email. Nothing about it is print-specific except the @media print block that
// already lives in NEWSLETTER_WEB_CSS and the dialog fired below.
