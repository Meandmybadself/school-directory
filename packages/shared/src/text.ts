 *  punctuation a teacher may simply have typed. An EM dash is the other
 *  convention in use here ("Room 12 — Ms. Okonkwo") and is deliberately still
 *  not a separator: every name of that shape is already two segments, so the
 *  rule below would return it unchanged anyway, and admitting a third dash
 *  character buys nothing for the risk of confusing it with the first two.
 *  A name with no `·` has no structure this can read and comes back untouched,
 *  which is what leaves CSS to do the clipping in that case. */

/** A classroom's name, reduced to the year and the teacher's surname.
 *
 *  This instance's rooms are named by the district's roster export and run four
 *  segments — `Grade 2 · Juntos · Pam Shrestha · Rm 322` — which is forty
 *  characters of subline under a person's name that has to stay the widest
 *  thing on the row. CSS ellipsis alone answers that badly, because it clips
 *  from the END: every child in a grade would truncate to the same
 *  `Grade 2 · Juntos · Pam Sh…`, which is worse than useless on a list whose
 *  whole job is telling two children apart.
 *
 *  So the label is `Grade 2 - Shrestha`: the year, and the name a parent
 *  actually uses for a room. Two rooms in one grade differ in their teacher,
 *  which is exactly the pair a reader is trying to distinguish.
 *
 *  **It reads its segments by SHAPE, not by position**, and that is the part to
 *  understand before changing it. The order is not stable across this project's
 *  own data: production rooms run grade-programme-teacher-room, while the demo
 *  seed's `Ms. Ruiz · Grade 4` puts the teacher FIRST. So the grade is whichever
 *  segment says "grade" (or names kindergarten), the room is whichever carries
 *  `Rm`/`Room` AND a digit, and the teacher is the segment BEFORE the room —
 *  falling back, where there is no room, to the last segment that is not the
 *  grade. That is what lets one rule read both shapes. It also means a
 *  programme name (`Juntos`, `XinXing`) is never mistaken for a teacher: it is
 *  identified by being adjacent to the room, not by being left over.
 *
 *  The surname is the last whitespace-separated word of that segment, so
 *  `Pam Shrestha` and `Ms. Ruiz` both reduce correctly. A teacher whose surname
 *  is itself two words (`Van Dyke`) reduces to the last of them; that is the
 *  known cost of a rule with no list of names to consult, and it stays wrong in
 *  a legible way rather than guessing.
 *
 *  That a person is written "First Last" is also what tells a teacher from a
 *  PROGRAMME: a one-word segment beside the room is `Juntos`, not somebody, so
 *  `Grade 2 · Juntos · Rm 322` — a room with no teacher recorded — comes back
 *  whole rather than labelled "Grade 2 - Juntos". The cost is a bare surname
 *  with no forename, which this refuses to read; the district's export has
 *  never written one, and refusing is the safe direction.
 *
 *  **Anything it cannot read comes back byte for byte**: fewer than two
 *  segments, no grade segment, no teacher distinct from the grade. A name with
 *  no `·` has no structure to read at all, which is what leaves CSS to clip
 *  `Room 12 — Ms. Okonkwo`. Silence beats a confident mislabel, because a row
 *  showing the WRONG room is worse than one showing a long right one.
 *
 *  It splits on the middle dot alone. An EN dash is inside "Ruiz–Lee", so
 *  splitting on dashes would cut a family down the middle of its surname, and a
 *  comma is punctuation a teacher may simply have typed.
 *
 *  It is **eliding, not translating**: invariant 6 forbids restating
 *  member-entered content in another language, and every character this returns
 *  is still the school's own. Nothing is lost either — the full name stays on
 *  `ClassroomRefDTO.name`, and a caller that shortens is expected to carry the
 *  original as a `title`.
 *
 *  Deliberately NOT applied to a household or a generic group; `groupLabel` is
 *  the kind test. The rule reads "grade" and "teacher" and only a classroom has
 *  those — `Grade 4 · Chess Club · Eisenhower` would come back as
 *  `Grade 4 - Eisenhower`, dropping the one segment that names the thing.
 *
 *  **This is a rendering step and must stay one.** Do not normalise a name on
 *  write with it: `resolveGroup` in `lib/bulkImport.ts` matches an existing
 *  group by exact, case-sensitive `WHERE name = ?`, so a roster import re-run
 *  against shortened names would fail to recognise the rooms it made last time
 *  and mint a duplicate of every one. `grp.name` stays the district's string;
 *  only the label changes. */

/** The one-line label for a group, whatever its kind.
 *
 *  `shortClassroomName` is deliberately named for the one kind it understands,
 *  so every caller that renders a mixed list of groups had to remember both the
 *  rule and the `kind` test that guards it. This is that test, written once: a
 *  classroom is elided, a household and a generic group come back untouched.
 *  It generalises the DISPATCH, not the rule — the segment-reading stays where
 *  its own doc comment explains what a segment means.
 *
 *  Every caller pairs it with `title={group.name}`, because the label is the
 *  only thing elided and the row must still carry the school's own string. Two
 *  consequences follow from that pairing and are the reason it is not optional.
 *  The full name stays in the DOM, so nothing is hidden from a reader who looks,
 *  from a hover, or from anything that reads the page. And `GET /groups` matches
 *  on the whole name — a search for a teacher finds rooms whose LABEL no longer
 *  shows them — which is invariant 18 read the safe way round (a row renders
 *  more than the label shows, never less) only because the `title` is there to
 *  show what matched. A group name is not private in the first place: any member
 *  may search every one of them, which is why this is a legibility trade and not
 *  a disclosure one.
 *
 *  A caller whose name WRAPS rather than clips — the pickers in the sheets, a
 *  profile's group card — uses this too, but must not gain an ellipsis on the
 *  way: wrapping loses nothing, and trading two readable lines for one cut-off
 *  one is the exact bug this exists to fix. Elide the label, leave the layout. */
